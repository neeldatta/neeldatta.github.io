					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<p> <img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/MyWireframe.png"/>
								Youtube 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>
							<p> <img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/BetterFrame.png"/> </p>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The website is supposed to play the video you have selected, as well as give you the option to interact with it through
								comments, likes, subscribing, etc. It also gives you suggested videos on the side to scroll through, as well as a search bar at the top and options 
								to access your own profile or change settings. The design accomplishes this by segmenting each of these interactivity options into different spaces
								on the page, while keeping the main video big and centered, removing clutter or unecessary background colors/noise. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> My redesign centered the video even more, removing the swath of related videos to scroll through on the side. I beleive this will help users focus
								on the video at hand instead of watching a few seconds of it and then skipping onto the next recommendation, a problem I personally face (alongside many 
								other people I know). The comments are also segmented away such that they have to be clicked upon to open, further removing distraction and providing a 
								more minimalist, focused user interface. It also hides the number of likes/subscribers as to promote  </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
