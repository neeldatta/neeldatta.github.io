						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the importance of picking the right font for the right purpose.
								Starting with identifying my purpose, and then narrowing down to my selected audience 
								for the job was very fascinating. I also learned that there was a such thing as "font 
								pairing," which I was not clued into at all previously. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the great amount of example fonts they provided to us through the various links, 
								such as typ.io, as well as the font pairing rsources they provided like Typewolf. Looking through
								these various resources gave me a larger perspective on the possibilities for 
								unique font combinations and styles that I had never been exposed to before. I also
								appreciated the tip on keeping in mind "readability, legibility, and purpose" whilst picking the perfect 
								font(s) and font pairings for the job.
