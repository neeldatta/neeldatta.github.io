                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> This article opened my eyes up to creative new ways of approaching design.
                                The ways in which each app/website incroporated their images and animations
                                alongside their layouts was very fascinating. It made me understand more of how to 
                                think about things like motion and aesthetics while designing.

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of this article is definitely seeing all the cool animations each inspiration used.
                                Ranging from the moving electric glow around the payment symbol for one of the examples, to the changing 
                                colored shapes in the background as the user scrolls in another, it opened my mind up to how to use 
                                simple animations to uplift a website.

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorites of the inspirations were the first app ("story"?) in the list, the second one, and the easygrow.ai brocolli one.
                                I liked these inspirations the best because they all incorporated really cool animations that fit the ambience of the rest of their
                                website. For example, the first one has a person falling over/doing a flip as the background, and has a sudden flood of dripping
                                color come transition the screen upon entering the login screen; these two images compliment eachother really well. The second site,
                            focusing on artwork/photography, used really cool, simple geometric animations in order to transition between focus on images, which
                        helps it achieve its goals of minimalism and a focus upon the images themselves. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 8. It was a nice change of pace to just indulge in some beautiful and engaging
                                UIs, and learn firsthand from observing rather than reading.</p>
