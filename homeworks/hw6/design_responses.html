					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> In this article I learned about how to match animation with human psychology to 
								optimize the User Experience (UX). I learned about ideal timing/duration for Animations
							depending on their purpose, as well as concepts such as easing (making the movement look more natural) 
						and equal interaction (animations occuring evenly across the screen). I also learned about how each of these
					concepts impact the user experience, and hwo to ideally design your app/website around this.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article is learning about easing. Easing is the manner in which movement/animation
								is timed such that it looks more realistic and natural, rather than forced. Within the concept of easing are the 
							sub-sections of linear motion, acceleration, and deceleration, as well as ease-in-out. I liked the ease-in-out idea
						the most as it incorporateed all of the aforementioned sub-concepts and employed them for the prupose of having an item move across the screeen,
					such that your eyes can follow it in a natural manner. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms. These figures are based on the particular qualities of the human brain." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
