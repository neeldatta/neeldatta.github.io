				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned a great deal about Dark Patterns from this article. I was not aware
							that this was an actual term, but I have definitely been keyed into many of the issues talked about
							in this article, like the email spams, fake ads on websites, and apps that sneakily change your browser
							or homepage. I was also interested to learn about the manipulation matrix, as I have never seen that before.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of the article is where it talked about the 11 types of dark patterns.
							It was really fascinating to see just how many different ways of intentional mainpulation people
							have come up with on the internet. I think the most interesting ones were definitely the disguised ads that
							appear to be as actual buttons/part of the website but redirect you or have you download things, 
							and misdirection (the Skype example, this actually happened to me multiple times
							when I was younger and it was frustrating)./p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> “ Find a way to help the vulnerable around you. If you have privilege, use it for good.”</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
