					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the importance of accesibility, and how you can 
								work your designs around accesibility so that everyone can equally
								make use of a web site. I learned about the regulations that are required 
								for government websites/websites associated with or working with the gov't, as well as
								what is required to achieve the W3C gold standard. I also was put onto ideas revolving around
								colors, specifically, and how to maintain certain contrast ratios and create patterns that can help
								those who are color blind with their visibility. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the part regarding not relying 
								solely on color for color accesibility. It was eye opening to understand the importance
							of using messaging and iconography instead of just a red outline, for example, to highlight something
						is going wrong. It was also fascinating to learn about using alternative color patterns to increase visibility 
					for colorblind people.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Focus states help people to navigate your site with a keyboard by giving them a visual indicator around elements. Theyâ€™re helpful for people with visual impairments, people with motor disabilities, and people who just like to navigate with a keyboard.
								" </p>
