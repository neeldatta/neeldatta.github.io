    <em>Data Science + Cognitive Science Major | 4th year</em>
    <p>Hello, my name is Neel Datta. I am currently finishing up my senior year
        at Cal, double majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science. I am interested
        in machine learning and the future of brain-computer interfacing systems; in my
        free time, I am an avid TURF dancer part of the SF based team Unknown (we're 
        the ones dancing on BART and hosting dance battles, etc)!

    <h3>Answers to the reading:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1) I learned the basics of developing my "product thinking." Keeping my mind open and aware of design choices whenever
            I use an app will help me understand how to thinl when I am developing my own web application/site.
        </li>
        <li>
            2) My favorite part of the article was learning about the four main things to keep in mind when looking at the design of an app.
            Looking at hierarchy, content, intent, and audience helps narrow the focus on important design choices through four crucial lenses.
        </li>
        <li>
            3) My favorite quote: "How could the design help to solve that problem even better?"
        </li>
        <li>
            4) I would score the article a 7, but only because it didn't go into too much depth.
        </li>
