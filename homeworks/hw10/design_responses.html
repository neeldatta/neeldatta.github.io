							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p> "Attention is a limited cognitive resource." This article was an extremely fascinating
								outlook into how we can center our design and user experience around maximizing a user's
								focus upon the website/app. As a cognitive science major, I fully believe in the ideas described within this article, 
								espcially the quote I have aforementioned. Some interesting examples were definitely the concept regarding "Cocktail Party Effect" and
								its visual cousin, "too many options". Both examples centered in on the idea that too much stimuli distracts us from being able to 
								focus in on one task or audio that is most important, a crucial things to note when designing and implementing a wesbite or app.</p>
