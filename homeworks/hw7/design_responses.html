						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about the Gestalt principles, which revolve around the idea that
								the organized whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It was cool linking 
								visual design with human psychology; using how the brain processes things within our
								design is important if we want to create ideal websites. It was interesting to learn about proximity, 
							i.e. how our brain associates things that are close to one another as related to one another, and how you can incorporate 
						this fundamental within design.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I think closure was the coolest of the different principles. A very fascinating concept within itself, 
								about how we percieve things to be as individuals even when the outline/shape may not be physically complete.
								It was very interesting to see how logos such as USA network or NBC use simple designs without full outlines, 
							since the closure principle makes us view the images as whole regardless! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Having an understanding how your brain works will help you become a wiser designer; master manipulator of Visual Communication. " </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
